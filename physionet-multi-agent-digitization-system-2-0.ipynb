    "\n",
    "This is the latest iteration of the ECG digitization pipeline, referred to as **Guardian 3.0**. It represents a highly robust architecture designed as a **Deep Learning-first system** with an optimized **Computer Vision (CV) Heuristic Fallback**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system's primary goal is reliability, ensuring accurate signal extraction even if cutting-edge AI models (YOLOv8 and Swin Transformer) fail to load in the execution environment. The entire process is managed by a Multi-Agent architecture to handle segmentation, calibration, and extraction."
